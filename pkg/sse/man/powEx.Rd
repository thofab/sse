\title{
  Defining the example to be used and the method to be used for sample
  size estimation.
}
\description{
  A function for constructing an object of class \code{power} used for
  drawing an example in a sensitivity plot and for evaluating sample size.
}
\usage{powEx(x, theta, xi = NA, endpoint = NA, power = 0.9, drop = 0,
method = c("default", "lm", "step"), lm.range = NA, forceDivisor = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{An object of class \code{powCalc}.}
  \item{theta}{a numeric value indicating for which \code{theta} to draw the
    example in the sensitivity plot and where to evaluate sample size. It makes
    only sense to use a \code{theta} in the range evaluated.}
  \item{xi}{a numeric value, as \code{theta} but for \code{xi}}
  \item{endpoint}{Object of class \code{character}, indidating for which
    endpoint sample size should be evaluated}
  \item{power}{Object of class \code{numeric}, indicating for what power
    samle size should be evaluated}
  \item{method}{Defining the method how the sample size for the
    indicated theta, xi, and power is "estimated". If the power object
    was created using resampling the "default" evaluates to "lm",
    otherwise to "step".}
  \item{lm.range}{The range of evaluations that are used for estimating
    the sample size if the \code{method} is set or evaluates to
    "lm". For the default \code{lm.range} = 0.2 this means from80 to
    120 \% of the power in the example, e.g. for the power of 0.9 this is a
    range from 0.72 to 1.08. Note that the range is cut at 0 and 1.}
  \item{drop}{Object of class  \code{numeric} (range: 0 to 1), indicating
    how many drop outs are expected in the study. 
    This information is used to calculate the number of subject that
    should be recruited (addressed e.g. by the function \code{tex} using
    type \code{nRec}).}
  \item{forceDivisor}{If \code{TRUE} the biggest common divisor of all
    evaluated sample sizes is used as divisor and the estimated sample
    size is increased to be divisible by this divisor. If an integer is
    provided it is used as divisor.}
}
\details{For method equal to "lm" a linear model is fit as lm(sample.size ~
  transformed(power)) with all data where theta, and xi are equal
  to the theta and xi of the example and within the power-range as
  defined by the argument \code{lm.range}. This model is then used for
  predicting the sample size. Always inspect the result using \code{inspect}!

  The method "step" returns the last element in the sequence of sample
  sizes - power pairs, sorted with decreasing power, where the power is
  above the power defined for the example.
}
\value{An object of class \code{power}.}
\seealso{In older verstions of the package: The function
  \code{merge} was used together with an object
  of class \code{powEx} to form an object of class \code{power}}
\examples{
## defining the range of n and theta to be evaluated
psi <- powPar(theta = seq(from = 0.5, to = 1.5, by = 0.1),
              n = seq(from = 20, to = 60, by = 2),
              muA = 0,
              muB = 1)

## defining a power-function     
powFun <- function(psi){
  power.t.test(n = n(psi)/2,
               delta = pp(psi, "muA") - pp(psi, "muB"),
               sd = theta(psi)
               )$power
}

## evaluating the power-function for all combinations of n and theta
calc <- powCalc(psi, powFun)

## adding example at theta of 1 and power of 0.9
pow <- powEx(calc, theta = 1, power = 0.9)

## drawing the power plot with 3 contour lines
plot(pow,
     xlab = "Standard Deviation",
     ylab = "Total Sample Size",
     at = c(0.85, 0.9, 0.95))

## changing the estimation method
pow2 <- powEx(calc, theta = 1, power = 0.9, method = "lm")

## drawing an inspection plot
inspect(pow2)
